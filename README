Code snippets for popular real-time OS to manage perpherals on a SPI
bus.

Unlike the usual code examples for performing io operations over an

code presented allows io operations on a shared SPI bus to occur
concurrently, taking advantage that most SPI device reads or writes
are done via a series of subcommands.
